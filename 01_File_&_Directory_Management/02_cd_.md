# `cd` Command — "Change Directory"
**Basic Syntax:**
```bash
cd [directory]
```
- It changes your current working directory to the specified one.
- You can use absolute paths (starting from /) or relative paths (from your current location).

## Core Use Cases
| **Command**       | **Description**                                        | **Example/Scenario**                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `cd`              | Go to your **home directory**                          | From anywhere: `cd`                                |
| `cd ~`            | Also goes to your **home directory**                   | `cd ~` is same as `cd`                             |
| `cd /path/to/dir` | Go to an **absolute path**                             | `cd /etc/nginx`                                    |
| `cd dir_name`     | Go to a **relative path**                              | `cd Documents` (if you're in home)                 |
| `cd ..`           | Move **one level up** (parent directory)               | From `/home/user/docs` → `cd ..` → `/home/user/`   |
| `cd ../..`        | Move **two levels up**                                 | Useful in deep folder structures                   |
| `cd -`            | Switch to the **previous directory**                   | Great when jumping back and forth between two dirs |
| `cd .`            | Stay in the **current directory** (no change)          | Rarely used alone, but useful in scripts           |
| `cd ~username`    | Go to another **user’s home directory** (if permitted) | `cd ~john`                                         |
| `cd /`            | Go to the **root directory**                           | Base of the filesystem                             |

# Real-World Scenarios
## 1: Return Home From Anywhere
```bash
cd
```
You're buried deep in `/var/log/nginx/old/errors`, but want to return to your home folder quickly.

## 2: Toggle Between Two Directories
```bash
cd -
```
You're working in `/opt/deploy` and need to jump back to `/home/user/scripts` repeatedly.

## 3: 3: Climbing Up the Tree
```bash
cd ../../
```
Quickly move up two levels — ideal in nested folder structures like `/home/user/projects/java/`

## 4: Navigate to Another User's Home
```bash
cd ~john
```
Check another user’s files if you have permission (like `/home/john/`).

## 5: Permissions or Mistakes
If you try:
```bash
cd /root
```
And you get:
```bash
bash: cd: /root: Permission denied
```
It means you need superuser access (sudo su) to access that directory.

## Combine With Other Commands
You often use `cd` with `&&` to perform an action only after a successful directory change:
```bash
cd /var/log && ls -lh
```
This first navigates to `/var/log`, and only if successful, lists files in long format.

## Common Aliases and Shortcuts
You can add shortcuts to your shell config (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`):
```bash
alias ..='cd ..'
alias ...='cd ../..'
alias back='cd -'
```
Reload shell with:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
